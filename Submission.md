BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON HOW YOUR PROJECT FITS INTO POLYGON TRACK
We all have tried and failed sticking to habits, with us you need to stake ETH to follow a habit & a failure leads to loss of the staked amount & it's interest to accountability partner. For each & every habit commitment contract the user is creating we add it to the smart contract on the Polygon chain.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON HOW YOUR PROJECT FITS INTO PUSH NOTIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION TRACK
We all have tried and failed sticking to habits, with us you need to stake ETH to follow a habit & a failure leads to loss of the staked amount & it's interest to accountability partner. As a part of the commitment contract we are using Push Notifications to send the user notifications for daily journal entries & also we will send push notifications to the accountability partner before & after the journal entry.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION ON HOW YOUR PROJECT FITS INTO IPFS & FILECOIN - GENERAL STORAGE TRACK TRACK
We all have tried and failed sticking to habits, with us you need to stake ETH to follow a habit & a failure leads to loss of the staked amount & it's interest to accountability partner. As a part of the commitment contract, the user needs to do a journal entry daily. To store all the journal entries for each habit we are using IPFS. We are using it to store images, videos & text.
